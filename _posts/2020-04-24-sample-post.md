In the last couple of years, I had been used multiple web browsers for my daily activities. I had used Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and even Chromium. But always my default browser was Chrome. When I installed a new operating system or when I changed my computer, the first software I wanted to install was the Chrome browser.

A couple of months back I have read a [blog](https://www.browserguides.org/brave-vs-chrome/) which is about a totally new browser called [Brave](https://brave.com/). That blog compared the Chrome browser along with Brave. As that blog stated Brave browser block ads, pop-ups, and provide high security, etc. But I don’t want to talk about all these things again. Instead, I just want to share my experience with the Brave browser.

# It is almost like chrome

The user interface of the Brave browser is very similar to Chrome. The search bar, result pages, and even settings page also similar to Chrome. So you can get that familiar Chrome experience from Brave and even more.

Moreover, all the extensions that support in Chrome also support in Brave. I really like to use Grammarly extension in my browsers. Currently, I’m using this Grammarly Chrome extension in my Brave browser without any issue.

# Yes, it blocks the ads and pop-ups

One of the fascinating features of Brave is it by default blocks all the ads and pop-ups that you might face while you are browsing. I tried several web sites with different browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Brave. I experienced that ad blocking and preventing the pop-ups in my Brave browser is a very fascinating feature.

Also, brave blocks 3rd party cookies tracking which happened in other browsers. However, to achieve these blocking mechanisms in other browsers, you will need third-party extensions but in Brave, it is not the case.
Due to this by default blocking system, you will feel that Brave is faster compared to other browsers.

# I like Brave UX

As programmers, we always love to have dark themes. The Brave itself has a dark theme. Therefore, I really loved to use the Brave with the dark theme on it.

One of the unique features of Brave is when you opened a new tab, the tab will show you a beautiful eye-catching picture. I love that feature because sometimes we are in stress to find out solutions for some of the complex programming issues. Sometimes, I spent days or even weeks to find out solutions to some of the problems. So, when we are coding we do not even see the nice desktop wallpaper on our computer. At that time we are so busy with browsing and trying multiple solutions. At that busy time, seeing a beautiful picture calm you down and it gives real comfort to your eyes unexpectedly. I experience it a lot and I love it very much.

# Do you love Tor?
If you are a person that uses Tor, then Brave can help you. Brave does not only supports private browsing but also supports private browsing using Tor. So you do not need any other software to use Tor, you can directly use Tor using Brave.

# Let’s summarize!

A couple of months back I changed my default browser to Brave. It has been a great experience for me to use this new browser. It will stop you seen unwanted ads and prevent a mess of pop-ups. The UI of brave is similar to chrome and the UX of brave make you comfortable during your browsing time. From my experience, I really recommend any of you to use brave and get an interesting experience from it.
